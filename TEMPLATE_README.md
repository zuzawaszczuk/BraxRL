## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of _[brief project description]_. The project focuses on _[key goals, e.g., training specific X model, analysing Y dataset, etc.]_.  

## Features/Functionalities
Key points of what exacly users can do or achive from our repository.
 - Clean code structure
 - Preconfigured GH CI with pytest and flake8
 - This template README

## Installation & Setup 
To get started with this project, follow these steps:  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** 
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**  
   - Copy the example `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.  
   - Update the values as needed. 

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset:  
   ```sh
   python3 -m src.dataset
   ```

2. **Train the Model**  
   Run the training script to train a machine learning model:  
   ```sh
   python3 -m src.modeling.train
   ```

3. **Analyze Results**  
   - Check the results in the `reports/` folder.  
   - Open and explore Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder for further analysis.  

## Examples  
In some cases, the project may serve as a tool or library. For these types of repositories, it's helpful to provide a variety of usage examples to demonstrate how the code can be applied.

## **Additional Resources**  
- Detailed information about project structure is provided in the [Project Organization](#project-organization) section.  
- Further explanations about model training and evaluation are documented in the `notebooks/` folder.
